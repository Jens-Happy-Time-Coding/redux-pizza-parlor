How to work together :)

making a new feature = make a new branch & go to that branch
  git checkout -b <branch name>
  (work on your feature)
  git add .
  git commit -m "bla"
  git push origin <branch name>
  on github, do a pull request
    may need to communicate with group and resolve conflicts
  git checkout master/main
  git pull
  now you're up to date
